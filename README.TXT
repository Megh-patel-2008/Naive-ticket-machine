It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

1. I completed all the step for question 1.
2. Once I enter an amount and printTicket all the amount i have inserted is gone
   the money it collects up like dept
3. When I insert a different amount it buys all the tickets possible with the money
   already inserted and it doesn't refund the money.
5. Even after creating another ticket machine object, nothing has changed compared
   to the first one.
7. Yes, it matters how we write it because switching class and public would ruin the code
   and it would become useless
8. Yes it is possible and even after removing it, it doesn't really show a diffrence
9. No, the word class has to stay there no matter what for the code to function
11.The features of the constructor that make it look unique: a) Same name as the class  b)
12.The first one is "int", the second one is "Student", the last one is "Server"
13.The first one is "alive", the second one is "tutor", the last one is "game"
15.The order of absolutaly matter. I it isnt followed the code will show error
16.Yes it is necessary for the code to be put in action
17.???
18.It belongs to th class "Student"
19.It has 2 parameters, but im not sure what their type is
20.Yes we can figure out the constructor's parameter because it would be inside the parentheses
21.???
22.I don't get what the challenge exercise is asking me to do
23.The only difference I see is that getBalance, returns the balance numbre and getPrice, returns the price of the ticket.
24.I would caracterize it as "How much balance so I have?"
25.No as long as the "private int balance;" in the TicketMachine isn't changed its supposed to work.
27.Once I removed "return" from "getPrice" it caused it to tell me "missing return statement"
28."getPrice" returns "int", while on the other hand "printTicket" has "void" as a return type
29.No, both of them don't haven a "return" statement.
31.public void increaseScore(int points)
{
    score=score+points;
}
32.???
33.public void discount(int amount)
{
    price=price-amount;
}
34.public void setAge(int currentAge)
{
    age = currentAge;
}
35.public void setAlive(boolean value)
{
    alive = value;
}
36.Even after changing the assignement nothing change in the output
37.My cat has green eyes.
39.I believe it wouldn't get the "price" but it print the word "prince" only
40.This would have printed all the words
42.They have different outputs but they each have their own price value
43.
