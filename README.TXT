It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.

1. I completed all the step for question 1.
2. Once I enter an amount and printTicket all the amount i have inserted is gone
   the money it collects up like dept
3. When I insert a different amount it buys all the tickets possible with the money
   already inserted and it doesn't refund the money.
5. Even after creating another ticket machine object, nothing has changed compared
   to the first one.
